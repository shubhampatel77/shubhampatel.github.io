👨🏻‍💻 I’m a final year graduate student at UT Dallas.

🧐 My research interests are in optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, developing diffusion models for personalized image generation!

📊 I’m currently working towards my Master’s Thesis in the field optimizing LLMs, specifically RAG models.

📽️ I am also interested in leveraging meta-learning for RL tasks like autonomous driving.
